# RogueNet

Work in progress envisioned to host social engineering phishing templates hosted on a server running on the ESP32

- Create fake free wifi sign-in options to trick victims into logging their gmail/instagram/facebook credential to 
  access free wifi.
- Allow custom templates to be easily uploaded. ( Using char byte arrays for now :-( manually placed on the html folder))
- Reset ESP32 On Faults
- Store password to file or download after an engagement.
